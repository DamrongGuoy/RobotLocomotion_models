# models

Shareable large model files (meshes, etc) for use in RobotLocomotion Group
research projects, including [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/).

Please note that the files contained in the repository may have related files,
such as URDF or SDF files, in the Drake repository.

**NOTE**: As of 2019-01-29, the branch `old_master` contains the original
models for the Fall 2018 session of
[MIT 6.881](http://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/). This branch may soon be
removed.
