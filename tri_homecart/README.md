# TRI HomeCart

The HomeCart is a bimanual manipulation station developed at the Toyota Research
Institute (TRI). The model files contained here are all developed by TRI, and
represent a slightly simplified version of the model files used internally at
TRI (most notably they are using a simplified version of the grippers).
